            <h2>Actions to be Taken</h2>
			<br>
            <h1><strong>1. Let girls’ and women’s voices be heard</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>Most importantly, #HearMeToo. Women and girls should be the at the centre of all design and delivery.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>2. Connect to those who know, who care</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>When developing programmes, ensure local women’s and youth organisations are consulted and build on their best practices and evidence. And for the                   many men and boys who are champions for an end to GBV, let’s work together.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>3. Light the way</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>All shelters, latrines, water points and pathways within camps must have ample lighting to reduce the risk of sexual violence.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>4. Be non-apologetic about female-only safe spaces</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>Most public spaces in emergencies are dominated by men and boys. Women and girls need a place where they can feel safe, report gender-based violence 	             confidentially, receive information and support, and build their social network and confidence.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>5. Make safe spaces mobile</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>The most vulnerable women, married adolescents, adolescent mothers, and disabled women and girls need services brought to them.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>6. Be aware of your surroundings. Don’t let your guard down</strong></h1>
          <ul><li>If things seem even a slight unsafe get out of that place immediately.</li></ul>
          

          <h1><strong>7. Trust yous instincts
            </strong></h1>
			<ul>
          <li>There will invariably be signs, however small or seemingly insignificant, that tell or alarm you that all is just not OK. You may not understand it or be                able to analyse it consciously, but please do NOT ignore it. It is your personal threat alarm beeping </li>
		<li>Make it a habit to read and notice these warning signs and go with your
            intuition to quickly retract yourself, move out or immediately get away from
           potentially unsafe situations.</li>
		   </ul>
   
          
          <h1><strong>8. Don’t take eve teasing lightly</strong></h1>
		  <ul>
          <li>Respond with a stern voice. </li>
		  <li>Threaten to take a picture which might scare them away. </li>
		  <li>If the eve teasing still persists then immediately raise your voice to gather a crowd.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1><strong>9. While driving a car:</strong></h1>
		  <ul>
          <li> Avoid parking at desolate area </li> 
          <li> Look inside the car especially the back seat before unlocking & entering </li>
          <li> Lock the doors immediately after entering the car </li>
          <li> Start the car & drive off rather then call someone. Calls can wait </li>
          <li> Don’t give lift to strangers </li>
          <li> Don’t stop your car for strangers, especially at night </li>
          <li> Take known routes, avoid short cuts which you don’t know. </li>
		</ul>

          <h1><strong>10. While travelling at night don’t keep your phone in your hand</strong></h1>
		  <ul>
          <li> Remember phone is the first thing your attacker will throw away</li>
          <li> Activate your speed dials which can be used to dial numbers in emergency </li>
          <li> Keep it in your pocket or at a place from where you can easily take it out & dial a number & leave it on </li>
          <li> Once the number has been dialled start shouting & try to speak out your
				location so that the other person can inform police about your location </li>
          <li> If you have a smart phone then install emergency apps which can send
            sms to known people & can even dial police no. in case of emergency. </li>
