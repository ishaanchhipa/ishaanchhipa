			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>India is sadly the 9th most dangerous and unsafe place for women to live or travel. India scored the
				worst out of our 50 countries
				in the gender inequality category. It also had poor rankings in intimate partner violence and the gender
				gap. Sadly, almost 90% of
				women who are raped in India knew the perpetrator. If the crime rates of 2018 and 2019 are compared,
				there has been an increase of
				7.3 per cent. A total of 4,05,861 cases of crime against women were registered during 2019. Every 16
				minutes, a woman gets raped in
				India. However, in 2019, the country had recorded 88 rape cases every day. Out of 32,033 reported rape
				cases in the year, 11 per cent
				victims were from the Dalit community. The problem mainly is that there is little to no gender
				sensitisation, public awareness or better
				policing. Problem is not girl roaming out at night or not wearing decent clothes according to society
				but the men who think they are
				superior or think all the women are their toys to play with and think they are above the law. We should
				change this all by changing our
				younger generation, cause being educated is not enough we have to be empathetic and understanding.
