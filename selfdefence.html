            <h1><strong>Why Self-Defence Is So Important For Women?</strong></h1>
            <p>
                Every day, either on social media or on Television, you are hearing about women being victimized. There
                are so many stories of women that are available and you can hear about sexual violence or a random
                attack by strangers as well as being abused in some way. The world is changing and becoming more
                unpredictable particularly for women. As such, self-defence training is one of the most needed and must
                for every woman’s to-do list. In the crime world, self-defence training is suggested, so that the women
                can resist any kind of sexual assault as well as random attacks.

            <h1><strong>Reasons for joining the self-defence Training Program</strong></h1>
            <p>

                Even now, women are not able to get equal rights in society. They are restricted to do their
                responsibilities. People should come out from these restrictions and limitations and motivate them by
                presenting gifts for women. The women are failed to protect themselves when they are facing any kind of
                sexual violence and random attack. The main reason for the failure is fear.</p>
            <p>The below mentioned are the reasons for joining the self-defence training program and usage of
                self-defence weapons.
                <br>
                • The program will improve self-confidence in a woman.<br>
                • The training program will keep you safe when you are away from your home<br>
                • It will reduce the dependency on others<br>
                • The training program will get you a healthy and fit lifestyle due to exercise and physical moves.<br>
                • It can handle dangerous and emergency situations that are caused by strangers.<br>

            <h1><strong>When to Join the Self-defence Program?</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The world will cause violence not only for adult women but also for young girls and children. The girl
                can join the course when she enters into her 11 age. Before joining the course, she should have physical
                fitness and a disciplined mindset. In most cases, the height of the girl is playing an important role in
                the eligibility criteria of the self-defence training. The girl should be at least 36 inches tall to
                start and join in the self-defence training. But an adult can join and learn a self-defence program at
                any time if they are physically fit.
