		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>India is sadly the 9th most dangerous and unsafe place for women to live or travel. India scored the worst out of our 50 countries in the gender inequality category. It also had poor rankings in intimate partner violence and the gender gap. Sadly, almost 90% of women who are raped in India knew the perpetrator.
 If the crime rates of 2018 and 2019 are compared, there has been an increase of 7.3 per cent. A total of 4,05,861 cases of crime against women were registered during 2019. Every 16 minutes, a woman gets raped in India. However, in 2019, the country had recorded 88 rape cases every day. Out of 32,033 reported rape cases in the year, 11 per cent victims were from the Dalit community. 
The problem mainly is that there is little to no gender sensitisation, public awareness or better policing. Problem is not girl roaming out at night or not wearing decent clothes according to society but the men who think they are superior or think all the women are their toys to play with and think they are above the law.
 We should change this all by changing our younger generation, cause being educated is not enough we have to be empathetic and understanding.<br>  <i><b><strike>Padhega India tabhi toh badega India</strike> , Samjhega India tabhi Badega India.</b></i>
